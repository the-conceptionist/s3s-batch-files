# s3s-batch-files
 Quick 'n dirty .BAT files for installing and updating S3S.

## Usage
Run "install.bat" in the folder above where you want your S3S install to be.
For example, if you want your installation to be in "D:\s3s", run the batch file in "D:\"

After the installation is complete, place "update and run.bat" inside the installation. You can then use that batch file to run s3s and have it update itself automatically.
